# OneChipMSX for [MIST Board](https://github.com/mist-devel/mist-board/wiki)

### Features:
- Based on [KdL's version](https://gnogni.altervista.org/)
- Normal/Turbo CPU speed
- 2 MB/ 4MB internal RAM
- Various extensions in Slot 1 and Slot 2
- SCART/VGA outputs
- YPbPr output
- SD-Card support for MSX-DOS

### Usage:

The core requires an SD-Card formatted for FAT16, and the first file in the root directory must be the MSX BIOS. However if it's inconvenient to use a separate card, then a virtual SD-Card also can be used in the form of a MSX.VHD file in the root directory of your main SD-Card. To prepare the storage, please refer to the [KdL's site](https://gnogni.altervista.org/), especially OCM-Extra Pack, which has the BIOS and the SDCreate utility. Or you can find/ask for a .vhd file in [Atari-Forum](http://www.atari-forum.com/viewtopic.php?f=115&t=30889).

### Download precompiled binaries and system ROMs:
Go to [mist-binaries](https://github.com/mist-devel/mist-binaries/tree/master/cores/msx). Copy the rbf
file to the root of the SD card.
